The Kalyan (great) minaret is a example of superior civil engineering and architectural creation. It has 14 different ornamental bands and was the first to utilise the glazed blue times that the Timurids later saturated Central Asia with. The rotunda has 16 arched fenestrations from which the call to prayer was made. It is a Djuma mosque, intended for the large numbers that attend Friday services.''';
